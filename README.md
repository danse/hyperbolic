The goal is to combine multiple needs:

- A low thresholds for new working relationships, creating an open
  channel for communicating with others
- Protection of the professional's resources and potential, so that
  their talent is not exploited or undervalued
- Simplification of complex paying and allocation schemas, leveraging
  an unifying principle that is easy to understand

The principle is: the less available time, the more the time is valuable
